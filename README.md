# Real-Time Emotion Detection using MTCNN and CNN

This project involves real-time emotion detection using a custom CNN model and MTCNN for face detection.
The system captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and classifies the detected faces into one of the seven emotion categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
